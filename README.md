### Exploratory analysis of 2013 behavioural risk survey system data with R

This project was part of Coursera's [Introduction to Probability and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro). It is part of a 5-course series. It is part of a 5-course series by Duke University. I went through the series earlier, when it was in a single course format, but hey; repetition is the mother of all learning, right? There is more material now and the teacher is really good at explaining concepts. No statistical tests in this assignment, just exploratory analysis. We got to make up and answer three questions by ourselves from the 2013 BRFSS survey. This is a slightly modified version of my submission.
